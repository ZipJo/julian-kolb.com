Homepage for Julian Kolb

There are a lot of non urgent to-dos here...
 - fix sendmail, to use smtp
 - convert to scss
 - get rid of a lot of php ('cause I don't like php...)
 - initial background for home should have some kind of user-friendly setting to allow positioning
 - move the "contact"-content into /content/ and let it load separately
